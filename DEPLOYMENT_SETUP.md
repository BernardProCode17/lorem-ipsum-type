## 🚀 How to Deploy

### Step 1: Set Up Firebase (10 minutes)

1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Create a new project
3. Enable Firestore Database
4. Copy your Firebase config
5. Create `.env.local` file in your project root:

```env
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_project.firebaseapp.com
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_project.appspot.com
VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_sender_id
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id
```

### Step 2: Test Locally

```bash
npm run dev
```

Visit http://localhost:5173 and test your game.

### Step 3A: Build for Gaming Platforms

```bash
npm run build:gaming
```

This creates a `dist-gaming` folder. Upload contents to:
- **Newgrounds**: Upload as ZIP
- **Itch.io**: Upload as HTML5 game
- **CrazyGames**: Upload through developer portal

### Step 3B: Build for Portfolio

```bash
npm run build:portfolio
```

This creates a `dist` folder. Deploy to:
- **Vercel**: `vercel` (easiest)
- **Netlify**: `netlify deploy --prod`
- **GitHub Pages**: `npm run deploy` (after setup)

## 🎨 Using the Config System

Import the config in your components:

```jsx
import config from './config'

export default function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <div>
      {/* Show footer only on portfolio, not gaming platforms */}
      {config.features.showFooter && <Footer />}
      
      {/* Show portfolio links only on standalone */}
      {config.isStandalone() && (
        <a href="https://yourportfolio.com">Back to Portfolio</a>
      )}
      
      {/* Compact UI for gaming platforms */}
      {config.isGamingPlatform() && (
        <div className="compact-mode">Game content</div>
      )}
    </div>
  )
}
```

## 🔐 Firebase Integration

You'll need to integrate Firebase for:
- User authentication
- Score storage
- Leaderboard data
- Game history

**Option 1**: Keep your custom auth + Firebase storage (recommended)
**Option 2**: Use Firebase Authentication

See your existing authentication docs for implementation details.
